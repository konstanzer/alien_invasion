# Alien Invasion
![](img/alien.bmp)

This remake of a classic arcade game is an good example of using sprites in object-oriented programming. The full instructions are available in *Python Crash Course*, 2nd ed., by Eric Matthes.

## How to play

After cloning this repo, navigate to the `src` folder, then type

```
$ python alieninvasion.py
```
## A note on environment

I established parameters using Windows 10 and a wide LCD monitor. These probably wont be suitable for other environments and can be fiddled with in `settings.py` and the `_create_alien` function.
